Download the app from Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hovig.bluemixparticleonoff. 

For the Spark setup you can still use the app to control the device. Download the app  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hovigandroid.bluemixsparkledapp. 

After that you put your credentials from Bluemix (www.Bluemix.net) and Particle Core (www.Particle.io). You have the choice to create 
a user name and Android device or else the app will generate them for by default which they will appear in your Bluemix app in 
the Push service. 

After entering the credentials, your app will be ready for use. Double check your Bluemix and Particle Core setups to make sure 
that the communication is in place.
