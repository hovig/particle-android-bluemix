# particlecore-android-bluemix


Spark has changed its name and now it's called Particle. For this reason, I have updated the code, the setups and the images of sparkcore-android-bluemix. This repo has the same setup formality of the previous but with it has a different name now.



This Project is a tutorial for turning an LED On/Off using Particle Core through Android mobile or through the web using Bluemix services. All the codes for Particle Core, Android, IBM Bluemix Noded-Red and IBM Bluemix Push notification are in this repository.

Note that this project can work together or separately also. For example, mobile project: Android - Particle Core and/or web: Bluemix(Node-RED, PUSH) - Particle Core.

Please follow the instructions inside each folder to have a successful project.
